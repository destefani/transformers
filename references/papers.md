# Transformers Papers

## Foundational Papers on Transformers:

1. Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al. (2017) - This is the seminal paper that introduced the transformer architecture.

2. BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding by Devlin et al. (2018) - Introduced BERT, which revolutionized NLP tasks with its pre-training and fine-tuning approach.

3. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI - This series of papers (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) showcases the power of transformers in generating coherent and diverse text.

## Transformers in NLP:

4. XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding by Yang et al. (2019) - Proposes a generalized autoregressive pretraining model.

5. RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach by Liu et al. (2019) - A variant of BERT that's more robustly optimized.

6. T5: Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer by Raffel et al. (2019) - A unified framework that casts all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format.

## Transformers in Computer Vision:

7. ViT: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale by Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) - Introduced the Vision Transformer (ViT) which applies transformers to image classification.

8. DETR: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers by Carion et al. (2020) - Uses transformers for object detection tasks.

## Unconventional Uses & Further Investigations:

9. Music Transformer by Huang et al. (2018) - Application of transformers for generating music.

10. The Transformer Family by Tay et al. (2020) - A comprehensive review of various transformer architectures, their modifications, and applications.

11. Transformers in Time Series - While there isn't a single definitive paper, there's growing interest in applying transformers to time series forecasting. Look for recent papers in this domain.

12. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer by Kitaev et al. (2020) - Introduces techniques to make transformers more memory efficient.

13. Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer by Beltagy et al. (2020) - A transformer model designed for long documents.
Applications in Other Domains:

14. AlphaFold: Using AI for Scientific Discovery by DeepMind - While not purely a transformer, this model, which made waves in predicting protein structures, uses attention mechanisms inspired by transformers.

15. Molecular Transformers for Predicting Bioactivity - There's emerging research on using transformers for predicting molecular properties and bioactivity. Look for recent papers in this domain.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but it should provide a solid foundation for understanding the evolution, applications, and innovations surrounding transformer models. As the field is rapidly evolving, it's also a good idea to keep an eye on major conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, and CVPR for the latest advancements.
